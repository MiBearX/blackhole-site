    <h1>What are Black Holes?</h1>

    <p>
        Black holes are regions of space where gravity is so intense that nothing — not even light — can escape. To understand how black holes work, we need to understand Einstein's theory of relativity and how it reshaped our understanding of space, time, and gravity.

    <h2>Relativity: The Foundation of Black Holes</h2>
    <p>
        In the early 20th century, Einstein introduced two revolutionary ideas: special and general relativity. Together, they explain how space and time behave at high speeds and in strong gravitational fields — such as near black holes.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Speed of Light is Absolute:</strong> All observers measure light's speed as constant, no matter their motion. This leads to <em>time dilation</em> (moving clocks run slower) and <em>length contraction</em> (moving objects appear shorter).</li>
        <li><strong>Mass and Energy are Equivalent:</strong> E = mc² means mass can be turned into energy and vice versa. Black holes often form when massive stars collapse, releasing enormous amounts of energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Gravity is Curved Spacetime:</strong> According to general relativity, mass bends the fabric of spacetime. Objects follow curved paths — called geodesics — through this warped spacetime.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These ideas predict black holes as natural consequences of extremely warped spacetime. When enough mass is concentrated into a small region, spacetime curves so much that even light can't escape — forming an event horizon. That boundary marks the point of no return.

    <h2>Formation of a Black Hole</h2>
    <p>
        When a star more than ~20 times the mass of the Sun dies, it can collapse under gravity. If the remnant core is heavier than about 2.5 solar masses, it forms a black hole.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Neutron stars</strong> form below this threshold, held up by neutron degeneracy pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Black holes</strong> form when nothing can stop the collapse — spacetime folds in on itself.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Event Horizon:</strong> The outer boundary where escape velocity equals the speed of light.</li>
        <li><strong>Singularity:</strong> A central point of infinite density — the collapse's endpoint.</li>
        <li><strong>Schwarzschild Radius:</strong> The distance from the center to the event horizon. Depends on the black hole’s mass.</li>
        <li><strong>Accretion Disk:</strong> A swirling disk of superheated gas and dust around a black hole that emits intense X-rays as matter spirals inward.</li>
        <li><strong>Photon Sphere:</strong> A region just outside the event horizon where light can orbit the black hole in unstable circular paths.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Detect the Undetectable</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>X-rays from accretion disks:</strong> Gas falling into black holes heats up and emits intense radiation.</li>
        <li><strong>Gravitational waves:</strong> Ripples in spacetime created by merging black holes, first detected in 2015 by LIGO.</li>
        <li><strong>Gravitational lensing:</strong> Black holes bend light from background stars, distorting their appearance.</li>
        <li><strong>Motion of companion stars:</strong> In binary systems, black holes tug visibly on nearby stars (e.g., Cygnus X-1).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hawking Radiation & Black Hole Evaporation</h2>
    <p>
        According to Stephen Hawking, black holes aren't entirely black. Quantum mechanics predicts that pairs of particles can form near the event horizon. One may fall in while the other escapes — creating <strong>Hawking radiation</strong>. Over time, this causes black holes to lose mass and slowly evaporate.
    </p>

    <h2>Famous Black Holes & Breakthroughs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>M87:</strong> The first image of a black hole’s shadow, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019.</li>
        <img src = "static/m87.jpg" style="width:900px;height600px">
        <li><strong>Cygnus X-1:</strong> An X-ray source that was the first source to provide strong evidence for a stellar-mass black hole.</li>
